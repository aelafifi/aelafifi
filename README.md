**👋  Hello, I’m Ahmed.**

I’m an Egyptian software engineer, and I’ve been building things for as long as I can remember — tools, apps, experiments, and sometimes full-blown machines. I work full-time with clients as a professional developer, helping bring ambitious products to life with clean architecture, performance, and reliability. But in my free time, I like to explore ideas of my own.

Most of my personal projects start with a scratch, grow into working prototypes, and — occasionally — end up buried in a folder called “_final_version_v2_real_final_”. I’ve always built for myself first, but more and more, I’m feeling the pull to share what I’ve made.

From rewriting parsers in TypeScript and reshaping JavaScript execution, to designing tools for creative workflows — I like to blend logic with curiosity, and I don’t stay in one lane for long. I obsess over how things work, how they could be better, and how to bring them to life.

Some of my work is nearly ready for others to use — the real challenge now is documentation, not development. And while the builder in me always wants to jump to the next idea, I’m carving out time to bring these projects out into the open, one thoughtful release at a time.
